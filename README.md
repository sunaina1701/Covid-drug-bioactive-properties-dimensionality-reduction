ðŸ’Š Dimensionality Reduction of COVID Drug Bioactivity Data

This project applies dimensionality reduction and regression models to explore and analyze bioactive properties of COVID-19-related drugs. Using both PCA and t-SNE, the dataset is visualized and simplified, followed by a performance comparison of multiple regression models based on mean squared error (MSE).

ðŸ“‹ Workflow Summary

1. Data Preprocessing
   
Loaded and cleaned the COVID drug bioactivity dataset for analysis.


2. Dimensionality Reduction

Performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Applied t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

Visualized both reduced feature spaces.



3. Modeling & Accuracy Check
   
Used regression algorithms to evaluate data representation:

Linear Regression

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor



4. Performance Evaluation
   
Compared all models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy and generalization.
